# Thesis / Paper Title
This repository is a companion page for the following project / paper:
> Dominik My≈õliwiec, Muhammad Arifin Hidayat. 2024. HLS vs MPEG-DASH: Energy Consumption Comparison of Streaming Protocols

It contains all the material required for replicating the study, including: the source code, data and documentation.

## Quick start
Here a documentation on how to use the replication material should be provided.

### Getting started

1. Download Big Buck Bunny in the highest quality from [the official website](https://download.blender.org/demo/movies/BBB/bbb_sunflower_2160p_60fps_normal.mp4.zip)
2. Unzip the file and place the mp4 file in the [src/public/videoScript/](src/public/videoScript/) directory
2. Generate the .mpd and .m3u8 streams for the Big Buck Bunny with the [video script](src/public/videoScript/script.sh).
Having [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and its path setup is required for this step.
2. After a couple minutes, the streams should be ready. Now from within the [src](src/) directory, run `npm install` to install hls.js and dash.js, which are required to run the webapp
3. After packages are installed, you can do one of the following from within the [src](src/) directory:
   1. test the webapp by running `npm run dev`
   2. if perf is installed, you can measure the energy usage by running the [run script](src/run.sh), then quickly opening the webapp (prefferably on another device)
   at device_ip:server_port/, where server_port is most likely `5713` and the device_ip is the ip of the device where the script was ran
